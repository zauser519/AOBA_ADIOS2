## Lorenz System Example

The [Lorenz system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system) is a very simple ODE which exhibits large sensitivity to initial conditions.

This example exhibits a number of capabilities of ADIOS: For example, how do we write data that is completely independent of other data rapidly?
How do we write complex data structures that are not naturally layed out as matrices?

The ODE to be solved is

We will use Taylor methods for ODEs, which are very easy to understand.

Namely, if we differentiate the right-hand side we get

and we can propagate our solution via analytic continuation

Normally, we would store the list

but we will be able to store less total data if we store the phase-space state

and use cubic Hermite interpolation for rendering.
In addition, it doesn't make much sense to *solve* our equation more accurately than we render it, so we'll simply use the second derivative to pick stepsizes.



A natural C++ data structure for this is a `std::vector<std::array<Real, 7>>`.
This will give us a nontrivial data structure to examine in ADIOS2.

Each MPI rank solves the Lorenz system with a different initial condition, and there is no coordination between ranks.
